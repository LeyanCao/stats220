# stats220
### Purpose of this repo
1. Prove my understanding of stats220, and use the projects I did for assignment to show my learning results in languages such as r language, markdown, rmd, etc.
2. By sharing my work using the open community Github, I have the opportunity to hear feedback from others to improve.
